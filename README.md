# Just-Fun
# EternalBite‚Ñ¢ - Infinite Flavor, Zero Regret üçîüåå

A surreal, humorous landing page for a fictional futuristic food brand that claims to deliver sentient burgers powered by AI, myth, and maybe magic.

##  What I Learned


- Styling and layout using `flex` and `padding` for responsive design
- Integrating custom fonts from Google Fonts (Orbitron & Roboto)


##  Favorite Features


- The **Fake Countdown Timer** that simulates urgency,
bold aesthetic using gradients and glowing box shadows

## If I Had More Time...

- Build a fully styled fake **Checkout Page** with input fields and confirmation animations
- Hook up a **funny chatbot assistant** (like a talking pickle) at the bottom corner
